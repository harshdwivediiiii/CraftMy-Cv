          text: `Here's a thinking process that leads to the resume and cover letter generation:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a professional resume and cover letter tailored for an internship or entry-level role in a specific industry. The output needs to be ATS-friendly, modern, concise, impactful, and structured correctly. It should emphasize potential and project work, be written in a specified tone/language/style, and incorporate provided details like skills, experience, education, projects, links, etc. Optional features include job description alignment, LinkedIn enrichment, career advice, and cover letter generation.

2.  **Deconstruct the User Input:** I need to identify and extract all the provided pieces of information from the user input fields:
    *   \`name\`: The candidate's name.
    *   \`target_role\`: The specific job title the user is aiming for.
    *   \`industry\`: The field the user wants to work in.
    *   \`experience_level\`: Confirms the target audience (Intern/Fresher/Entry-level). This is crucial for framing the content.
    *   \`skills\`: List of technical and soft skills. Needs parsing (comma-separated).
    *   \`work_experience\`: Details of previous jobs (company, role, dates, responsibilities/achievements). Needs careful formatting into bullet points.
    *   \`education\`: Details of academic background (degree, university, dates, relevant coursework/GPA).
    *   \`projects\`: Key information for entry-level roles (title, description, tech stack, GitHub link, deployed link). Needs structuring.
    *   \`certifications\`: Optional list of relevant certifications.
    *   \`achievements\`: Optional list of accomplishments (awards, recognitions, etc.).
    *   \`github_profile_url\`: Link to GitHub profile.
    *   \`portfolio_url\`: Link to personal website or portfolio.
    *   \`linkedin_url\`: Link to LinkedIn profile.
    *   \`gap_notes\`: Explanation for any employment gaps (handle sensitively if needed, often omitted from resume unless specifically required).
    *   \`job_description\`: *Crucial* for tailoring. If provided, keywords and required qualifications need to be identified and woven into the resume.
    *   \`language\`: Target language for the output. Default is English.
    *   \`tone\`: Desired writing style (Professional, Friendly, Assertive, Creative).
    *   \`design_style\`: Visual aesthetic preference (Minimalist, Modern, Colorful). This influences formatting choices.

3.  **Outline the Resume Structure:** Based on best practices for entry-level roles, the standard structure is:
    *   **Contact Information:** Name, Phone, Email, Location (City, State/Country), LinkedIn URL, GitHub URL, Portfolio URL.
    *   **Summary/Objective:** A brief (2-3 sentence) statement highlighting key skills, career goals, and enthusiasm for the target role/industry. For entry-level, an objective focusing on applying skills and learning is often suitable.
    *   **Skills:** Categorized list (e.g., Technical Skills, Soft Skills, Languages). Parse the \`skills\` input. Add relevant keywords from the job description if provided.
    *   **Experience:** Detail previous roles (even internships or part-time jobs). Use action verbs and quantify achievements where possible. If no formal work experience, this section might be minimal or omitted, placing more emphasis on Projects.
    *   **Projects:** *Very important* for entry-level. For each project: Title, concise description focusing on purpose and *outcome/achievement*, Tech Stack used, link to GitHub repo, link to deployed version (if available).
    *   **Education:** Degree, Major, University, Graduation Date (or Expected Date), relevant coursework, GPA (if strong), academic honors.
    *   **Certifications (Optional):** List relevant certifications.
